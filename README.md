# Ryan Smith

PhD student at University College Dublin. My research interests are in the application of machine leaning to study fluids, and in particular my work is focused on computer vision methods applied to breaking ocean waves.

I also enjoy playing chess, reading, taking hundreds of pictures of my cat on a daily basis and occasionally surfing.
