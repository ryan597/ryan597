# Ryan Smith

PhD student at University College Dublin in the School of Mathematics and Statistics. My research interests are in the application of machine leaning to study fluids, and in particular my work is focused on computer vision methods applied to breaking ocean waves.

I also enjoy playing chess, reading, and training BJJ.
